# ansible-pihole
Bootstrap a Raspberry Pi with Ansible and install Docker + Pi-hole

Optionally you can enable HA (high availability) with keepalived and sync settings between multiple instances.

The repository contains four Ansible Playbooks. Each one is described here shortly.

## Base Setup
- An [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) controller machine with Ansible [installed](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) (version 2.10 or later)
- The [openssh_keypair](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/crypto/openssh_keypair_module.html) Ansible module installed.
- One or more Raspberry Pi's with [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit)
- Headless setup (configuration before first boot):
  - Enable [SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md) `"3. Enable SSH on a headless Raspberry Pi..."`
  - Enable [wireless networking](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) or connect with LAN
- Set static IPs for your Raspberry Pi's (static DHCP assignment/reservation in your Router/DHCP server is sufficient)
- Configure your targets (IPs of your Raspberry Pi's) and other settings in [`inventory.yaml`](inventory.yaml)  
You can add or remove hosts in the inventory, depending on how many Raspberry Pi's you use.

## `bootstrap-pihole.yaml`
This playbook is for the first time run (but it can be rerun any time).  
It will bootstrap a fresh Raspberry Pi OS installation, install Docker, and Pi-hole.  
These roles are included:
- [`bootstrap`](roles/bootstrap/tasks/main.yaml): Some basic configuration  
  - Add the ssh key fetched from your GitHub user, configured in [`github_user_for_ssh_key`](inventory.yaml#L13) (Alternatively you can also set your ssh key directly [here](roles/bootstrap/tasks/main.yaml#L3))
  - Lock the password to prevent local terminal login
  - Set some useful bash aliases
  - Set language to en_US
  - Set timezone, configured in [`timezone`](inventory.yaml#L14)
  - Set hostname to the respective Ansible inventory_hostname
  - Set a static DNS server, configured in [`static_dns`](inventory.yaml#L15)
- [`updates`](roles/updates/tasks/main.yaml): Update apt packages
- [`sshd`](roles/sshd/tasks/main.yaml): Harden the sshd config  
  - Disable root login
  - Disable password authentication
- [`docker`](roles/docker/tasks/main.yaml): Install and configure Docker
- [`pihole`](roles/pihole/tasks/main.yaml): Start/Update Pi-hole container
  - Pi-hole container settings are configured in [`inventory.yaml`](inventory.yaml#L17-L24)

## `update-pihole.yaml`
This playbook is for subsequent runs after the `bootstrap-pihole.yaml` playbook was run at least once.  
It contains only a subset of roles for faster runtime: [`updates`](roles/updates/tasks/main.yaml) and [`pihole`](roles/pihole/tasks/main.yaml)  
This will keep the system up to date and can be used to roll out changes to the Pi-hole docker container, for example a new image version.

## `keepalived.yaml`
This playbook enables a high availability failover cluster with `keepalived` between multiple Pi-hole instances.  

Motivation:  
- Redundancy: Avoid a single point of failure (due to raspberry pi reboot, docker container failure/update/restart)
- Architecture of DNS requires a HA solution on the DNS server side (most clients will not properly handle unavailable DNS servers; if a client has multiple DNS servers configured it will try them one after another only moving on if one times out)
- Poor DNS query performance during system updates & docker image pulls (experienced on my Pi 3 Model B)

Since the version of keepalived and its dependencies in the Raspberry Pi OS buster sources is heavily outdated (and has some nasty bugs), the playbook will upgrade the system to Raspberry Pi OS bullseye which includes a more recent keepalived version.  
As healthcheck, the status of the Pi-hole docker container is evaluated.  
Communication happens over VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) which uses Multicast.  
The priority of each Pi-hole can be configured in [`inventory.yaml`](inventory.yaml), for example:
```yaml
    pihole-1:
      ansible_host: 192.168.178.45
      priority: 101
```
The desired VIPs (Virtual IPs) for IPv4 and IPv6 can be configured in [`inventory.yaml`](inventory.yaml#L25-L26):
```yaml
    pihole_vip_ipv4: "192.168.178.10/24"
    pihole_vip_ipv6: "fd00::10/64"
```

When maintaining and updating your Pi-hole instances with the `bootstrap-pihole.yaml` and `update-pihole.yaml` playbooks, the first step stops keepalived and therefore shifts the VIP to another instance so that the performance of DNS queries is not impeded.

## `sync.yaml`
This playbook enables the synchronisation of settings between multiple Pi-hole instances.  
One Pi-hole functions as the primary instance and the others as secondaries which pull from the primary.  
Syncing is scheduled as a cronjob and set to run two times per day (frequency can be changed [here](roles/sync/tasks/main.yaml#L28)).  
What gets synced:
- `gravity.db` (Adlists, Domains, Clients, Groups, Group Assignments of all aforementioned items)
- `custom.list` (Local DNS Records)
- `05-pihole-custom-cname.conf` (Local CNAME Records)

If you enabled HA (high availability) with the `keepalived.yaml` playbook, the primary instance will be the one currently occupying the Virtual IP address (evaluated at each cronjob run).  
Otherwise you can set the [`sync_target`](inventory.yaml#L27) variable to the IP address of your primary Pi-hole instance.

Default: Pull from VIP
```yaml
sync_target: "{{ pihole_vip_ipv4.split('/')[0] }}"
```
Alternative: Pull from primary instance (assuming your primary is `pihole-1`, otherwise adapt)
```yaml
sync_target: "{{ hostvars['pihole-1'].ansible_host }}"
```

For syncing, `rsync` is used which will only transfer files if they contain changes.  
Changes to `gravity.db` will trigger a docker container restart to pick up the changes.  
Changes to DNS & CNAME records get picked up on the fly.
